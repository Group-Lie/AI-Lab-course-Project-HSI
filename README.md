Mine report for this project is Report.ipynb, all the results and discussions that I want to present are in this notebook.

Other notebooks can be ignored, which are just used to do hyperparameter scanning and training results analysing.

All the raw training results are saved in the 'datas' folder.

To run the Report.ipynb, set the data_dir in the fourth code cell of it as your own local direction storing the data, i.e. the downsampled ICVL HBIs.

Some images in the markdown cells of the Report.ipynb are from the 'data' folder, thus viewing the Report.ipynb at the Github or at the local address after pulling the repository to the local is preferred.
